# Sexpy
Automatically derives s-expression parsers from Rust type definitions.
This library is meant for simple Programming Language definitions and gives you some
control of the parsing of the language.

## Tasks
- Nicer parsing messages
- After parsing, allow error messages to point to syntax
- Write documentation
